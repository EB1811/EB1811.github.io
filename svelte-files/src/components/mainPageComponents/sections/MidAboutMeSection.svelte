    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-400">
      I am someone who enjoys playing with different technologies; Typescript,
      frameworks such as React and Svelteâ™¡, cloud development, and much more. I
      develop professionally with the AWS ecosystem, integrating services such
      as Lambda, Amplify, and DynamoDB. I am someone who loves to learn, as well
      as teach, sharing new techs I discover with the brilliant developer
      community.
