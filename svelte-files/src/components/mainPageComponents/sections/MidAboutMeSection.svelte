      I enjoy playing with frontend technologies, having worked with Typescript,
      and frameworks such as React, Vue and Svelte. Im also skilled in cloud
      development, building apps with Firebase, and developing professionally
      with the AWS ecosystem, integrating services such as Lambda, Amplify, and
      DynamoDB. I am someone who loves to learn, as well as teach, sharing new
